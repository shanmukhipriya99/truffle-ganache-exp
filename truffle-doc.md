Following are some important points from the Truffle documentation.

- `truffle unbox <box-name>` command can be used to download any of the other truffle boxes.
- `truffle init` command can be used to create a bare truffle project without any smart contracts.
- `truffle create contract <contract-name>` command allows you to create a new smart contract of the specified name.
- `truffle compile`: compiles the smart contract.
- `truffle migrate`: to deploy the contract in the network.
